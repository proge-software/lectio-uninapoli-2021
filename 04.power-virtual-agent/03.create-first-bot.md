## CREATE YOUR FIRST BOT

Before you start creating bots, it is important to consider what the bot will be used for. For example, you might use the bot to handle account inquiries, or you could use it for self-service support cases such as knowledge base access. Knowing how you plan to use the bot will help you define and plot out conversation paths and determine how many topics the bot will handle.

Once you have in mind this, it&#39;s time to create the Bot.

## TEST YOUR BOT

Because a bot is made up of multiple topics, it is important to ensure that each topic is working appropriately and can be interacted with as intended. You can test your bot in real time by using the test bot panel, which you can enable by selecting Test your bot at the bottom of the side navigation pane. When the panel displays, the button name changes to Hide your bot so that you can hide it if more space is needed during the design process.

In order to do so, follow these simple three steps:

1. Click on &quot;Test your bot&quot; button on the left bottom side of the screen:

![image](images/test-bot1.png)

1. Type a phrase or a word and check if the Bot is performing as expected:

![image](images/test-bot2.png)

1. If it is not performing well, check the topic that is not working and adjust it till it works as expected

By testing your bots often throughout the creation process, you can ensure that the conversation flows as anticipated. If the dialog does not reflect your intention, you can change the dialog and save it. The latest content will be pushed into the test bot, and you can try it out again.

## PUBLISH THE BOT

After your bot content has been created, it needs to be published so that customers can engage with it. Published bots can be made available across multiple platforms and channels. Before a bot can be added to channels, interacted with, or used by team members, it will need to be published at least once.

Publishing bots as you make changes also ensures that customers are engaging with the latest bot content. When you are ready to publish your bot, select the  **Publish**  tab on the side navigation pane. During the publishing process, the bot will be checked for errors. Bot publishing typically takes a few minutes. When the publish is successful, the top of the page will display a green banner indicating that everything worked correctly. If errors are detected, you will be notified through a message that is displayed in the application.

Here a short guide on how to do it:

1. Click on the &quot;Publish&quot; section on the Menu on the left side of the screen:

![image](images/publish-bot1.png)

1. On the appearing screen, click on the &quot;Publish&quot; button:

![image](images/publish-bot2.png)

1. On the appearing window, click again on the &quot;Publish&quot; button:

![image](images/publish-bot3.png)

1. Once published, you will be noticed with a green bar at the top of the page:

![image](images/publish-bot4.png)

## INTEGRATE THE BOT IN A DEMO WEBSITE

Before the bot is deployed to the different channels that use it, you might want to gain feedback from other team members. When a bot is first published, it can be made available to the demo website. You can provide the demo website&#39;s URL to team members or stakeholders to try it out. The advantage of using the demo website is that the experience is different than testing the bot during the design process. Because the test bot experience is only intended to allow bot authors to test it, the demo website link increases the pool of users that can test and provide feedback that is related to the overall experience of the bot.

To add a bot to the demo website, select the demo website link under Share your bot. This webpage demonstrates what your bot looks like to a user who comes to your webpage. The bot canvas is at the bottom. You can interact with it by entering text in the window or by selecting a starter phrase from the provided options.
